# Spring Boot Mini Project

## Project Description

This project is a result of following the tutorial content on the Bilibili platform and utilizing resources provided by 黑马程序员 (the instructor). (Course Link: https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1m84y1w7Tb/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click&vd_source=9b7ba55a5fe4c8a3c0e0556e479f968e) The focus of this repository is on the backend development of a mini project. The project is based on the basic operations of the Spring Boot framework and covers the three main components: Controller, Service, and DAO. It aims to demonstrate the fundamental mechanisms of Inversion of Control (IOC) and Dependency Injection (DI).

## Overview

The repository contains the backend implementation of the mini project. It primarily follows the instructor's instructions and showcases the usage of Spring Boot framework components. Although a Vue frontend framework is included (provided by 黑马程序员), it is not the main focus of this demonstration.

## Features

- Basic CRUD operations using Spring Boot
- Demonstrates the implementation of Controller, Service, and DAO components
- Showcases the principles of IOC and DI in Spring Boot

## Technologies Used

- [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
- Vue (provided by 黑马程序员)

## Getting Started

To run and test the project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the necessary prerequisites installed.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
4. Run the `SpringbootWebQuickstartApplication.java` file for testing and debugging.

## Usage
